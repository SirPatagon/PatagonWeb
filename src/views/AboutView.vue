        <p>
            I'm a software developer and IT specialist from Germany.
            I've always loved tinkering with my PC since I was in third grade and that has not really changed since then.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently I'm especially interested in building, managing and maintaining server infrastructure, both locally at home and in the cloud&trade;.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also love experimenting with web design and redoing my website every now and then or adding new features to it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have a wide range of interests, including computer science and software development, language, history, theology/mythology, geography, physics and chemistry.
